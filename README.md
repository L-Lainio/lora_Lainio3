## Technologies Used

In the Advanced CSS Challenge for creating a Professional Portfolio, several technologies can be utilized to enhance the design and functionality of the portfolio website. These technologies include CSS variables, flexbox, and media queries. CSS variables allow for the creation of reusable style properties, making it easier to maintain a consistent design throughout the website. Flexbox provides a powerful layout system that enables the creation of complex and responsive layouts with ease. Media queries allow for the adaptation of the website's layout and design based on the device's screen size, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. By leveraging these technologies effectively, students can create a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio that showcases their skills and projects in a professional manner.
