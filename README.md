# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
# Module 2


# User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Description
A well-crafted portfolio can effectively demonstrate your skills and abilities to potential employers seeking candidates for part-time or full-time positions. A successful portfolio not only showcases your best work but also provides insight into the thought processes behind it. Students who present portfolios featuring live web applications often achieve success in their job search after completing the boot camp. It is essential to emphasize that having multiple deployed projects is a key requirement for securing initial interviews at many companies.

Considering these factors, this Challenge offers you the opportunity to lay the foundation for your future success by applying the fundamental skills you have recently acquired, such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Through this Challenge, you will have the chance to hone your new skills while creating a valuable asset for your job search. This endeavor presents a mutually beneficial opportunity that you will likely appreciate in the future.
